# Inspiration

This app was inspired from my time watching my fiance play Adult League Basketball. I wanted to create a live reporting system that would allow people interested in the league to track the game's progress in real-time as well as get access to the game's statistics. The app is built using Next.js, Neon, and Vercel for deployment.
